# CT6013-Java-Library-Systems-Database-
University project for Library application using databases and Java
This Java application connects to a Oracle database to manage a library booking system that was made during a University assignment 
linking with databases
Currently the database for this application doesn't exist so if you want to try and run it you'll need to make your own database server
for the application however there are SQL files that can be found in this project to save time on making the database.
